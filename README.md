## What is DevSecOps
[DevSecOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/devsecops)—short for *development, security, and operations*—automates the integration of security at every phase of the software development lifecycle, from initial design through integration, testing, deployment, and software delivery.
>DevSecOps makes application and infrastructure security a shared responsibility of development, security, and IT operations teams, rather than the sole responsibility of a security silo. It enables “software, safer, sooner”—the DevSecOps motto–by automating the delivery of secure software without slowing the software development cycle.

DevSecOps is important for the following key reasons: *speed, and security*
* Rapid, cost-effective software delivery
* Improved, proactive security
* Accelerated security vulnerability patching
* Automation compatible with modern development
* A repeatable and adaptive process
